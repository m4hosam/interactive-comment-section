## Overview

### The challenge

Users are able to:

  

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies

- only edit or delete their own comments and replies.

- Upvote and downvote comments
- All Comments are saved on the MongoDB Atlas
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal pops up before a comment or reply is deleted.
